## Sample TypeScript using Node.js

This project demonstrates how to build a fitness assistant application using Node.js, TypeScript, and the Gemini API, and is designed to be used with Daytona. It includes features such as user authentication, get fitness advice, and get nutrition advice.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Open Using Daytona

1. **Install Daytona**: Follow the [Daytona installation guide](https://www.daytona.io/docs/installation/installation/).
2. **Create the Workspace**:

   ```bash
   daytona create https://github.com/Thund3rHawk/fitness-assistant.git
   ```

3. **Explore the Project Routes**:

   The fitness assistant application provides several routes to interact with the system. Below are the main routes available:

   - **User Authentication**:

     - `POST /api/v1/auth/sign-up`: Register a new user.
     - `POST /api/v1/auth/sign-in`: Authenticate an existing user and obtain a token.

   - **Fitness Advice**:

     - `POST /api/v1/getFitnessAdvice`: Get personalized fitness advice based on user data.

   - **Nutrition Advice**:
     - `POST /api/v1/getNutritionAdvice`: Get personalized nutrition advice based on user data.

   Each route is designed to handle specific tasks and return appropriate responses. Ensure you have the necessary authentication tokens when accessing protected routes.

4. **Start the Application**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Setting Up Environment Variables

Before running the application, you need to set up the environment variables. Follow these steps:

1. **Create a `.env` file** in the root directory of the project.
2. **Add the following environment variables** to the `.env` file:

    ```plaintext
    PORT = 3000
    DATABASE_URL = your_mongodb_url
    GEMINI_API_KEY = your_gemini_api_key
    JWT_SECRET = your_jwt_secret_key
    ```

   Replace `your_jwt_secret_key` and `your_gemini_api_key` with your actual secret key and API key.

3. **Save the `.env` file**.

These environment variables are essential for the application to run correctly and securely.

### Using Postman for API Testing

You can use Postman to test the API endpoints provided by the fitness assistant application. Follow these steps to set up Postman for testing:

   1. **Install Postman**: Download and install Postman from the [official website](https://www.postman.com/downloads/).
   
   2. **Import the API Collection**:
    - Open Postman and click on the "Import" button.
    - Import the provided Postman collection file (`fitness-assistant.postman_collection.json`) from the project repository.
   
   3. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
    - In Postman, go to "Environments" and create a new environment.
    - Add the following variables to the environment:
      - `baseUrl`: `http://localhost:8080/api/v1`
      - `jwtToken`: Your JWT token obtained from the sign-in route.
   
   4. **Testing the Endpoints**:
    - Use the imported collection to test the various endpoints.
    - Ensure you have the `jwtToken` set in the environment for authenticated routes.

By using Postman, you can easily test and debug the API endpoints to ensure they are working as expected.
